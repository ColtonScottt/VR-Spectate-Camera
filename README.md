# Free-Camera-Script

this was made for vr, but you can use it for screenmode too
for the oculus intergration, you gotta make sure the displays are set properly (for me, i set them both to no eyes main camera and that seemed to work)
THIS WAS MADE FOR OCULUS HEADSETS I DONT KNOW IF IT WORKS FOR OTHER BRANDED HEADSETS
